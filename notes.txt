1. We can't choose list_devices because it returns a string, need to cast Spectrometer on it (the one from the seabreeze library)
2. No need to reimport
3. Choose from_first_available() works fine
4. Cannot reimport, leads to an error
5. Blinks only once? Need more testing
6. Needs some time to reconnect
7. Don't use from_first_available(), error with reconnecting multiple times in a row
